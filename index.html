        <p>
          If you want to become a software developer without any prior
          experience, here are some valuable tips to get you started:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Define your goals and choose a programming language: Determine which
            area of software development interests you the most, such as web
            development, mobile app development, or data science. Based on your
            interests, select a programming language to focus on, such as
            <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em>, or <em>Java</em>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Start with online tutorials and courses: There are numerous free
            learning resources available online that can help you kickstart your
            learning journey. Here are five recommended platforms: <br /><br />

                The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was
                learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer
                science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding
                school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This
                project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying
                to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
                The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum
                that can be taken entirely online. Since its inception, it has
                helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted
                countless others in learning enough programming to work on their
                own personal projects.

            Practice with coding challenges and projects: As you progress, it's
            essential to practice coding regularly. Platforms like
            <em>HackerRank</em> and <em>LeetCode</em> offer coding challenges
            and algorithmic problems that can sharpen your problem-solving
            skills.

            Build projects and contribute to open-source: Hands-on projects are
            a crucial part of learning. Start by building small projects to
            apply what you've learned. Additionally, contributing to open-source
            projects on platforms like <em>GitHub</em> can help you gain
            real-world experience and collaborate with other developers.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Engage with the developer community: Join online forums, discussion
            boards, and programming communities like <em>Stack Overflow</em> and
            <em>Reddit</em>. Participating in these communities can help you
            seek advice, share knowledge, and connect with experienced
            developers.
